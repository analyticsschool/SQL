## SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to insert, update, and retrieve data from a database, as well as to manage database structure and user access control. SQL is supported by many relational database management systems including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## RDMS
A Relational Database Management System (RDMS) is a software system that is used to manage and organize data stored in relational databases. It allows you to store and retrieve data by creating tables, defining relationships between tables, and using SQL to manipulate and query the data.

For example, consider a simple database for a library. The database has three tables: Books, Members, and Loans. The Books table stores information about the books in the library such as title, author, and ISBN. The Members table stores information about library members such as name, address, and membership number. The Loans table stores information about which books have been loaned to which members and when they are due to be returned.

By using relationships between the tables (e.g., a member can have many loans, but a book can only be loaned to one member at a time), the RDMS can help you to keep track of which books have been loaned, who they have been loaned to, and when they are due to be returned. This makes it easy to search for information, update records, and generate reports. SQL is the most common language used to interact with relational databases.
